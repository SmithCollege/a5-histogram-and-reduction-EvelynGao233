This time the homework assignment includes much more coding than the previous one, but the good thing is that I am already familiar with how to write CPU and GPU and record their time. The most difficult part is the workload and figuring out how to write different algorithms. I searched a lot and also asked GPT for an explanation of each algorithm and how they are different. Next time I will start early on the assignment and try to finish it early.
